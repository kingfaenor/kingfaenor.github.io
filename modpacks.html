                    this page is full of a few random things that are needed in general to play modspacks. Usually. Or at least I consider them essential to my modpack experience, and without these tools I don't really know how to help. So using other tools/launcher is totally fine but it's up to you to get it to work not me :)

                <span class="underline" name="intro"><strong>MultiMC</strong></span><a href="#top" class="top_button"><i class="top_button_caret"></i></a>
                <div id="text">
                    First, we need to install a launcher called MultiMC. This launcher takes the place of either the base minecraft launcher or the Twitch launcher or the old FTB launcher. It has more functionality and works better than all of them, trust me, you'll love it.<br><br>

                    Go <a href="https://multimc.org/" target="_blank">here</a> to downloaded it. Scroll down until you find the "Windows" installation. Or whatever OS install you need. Once you have installed the zip file you should open it an extract that folder to wherever you want, wherever drive you use for mass storage would be best, as assets/mods/packs/textures might take up valuable boot drive space if it's limited. That's it, you're done :). To launch find the exe and go through the setup. You do need java. There's other tutorials for that though.

                <div id="text">
                    Technically that's all you need to do this on your own, but there are a few settings that I have changed as part of later tutorials that make life so much easier. Go into settings and change the update channel to development. That's really the only option needed, the rest are all preferential or extraneous. <br>
                    Now just hit "Update" on the main menu to install the changes.
