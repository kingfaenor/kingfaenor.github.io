                    So I've tried to make this as easy as possible for anyone to join, then in the future it's easier for me to start a new pack or make changes or do a custom pack or something. The things that I've pre-gathered are: <br>texturepacks,<br> a shader mod and <br>a shaderpack,<br> and then how to download the pack itself.
                </div>

                        I'm going to assume that you've already installed multimc and change specific settings to allow you to follow this.<br><br>
                        First, we want to create (add) a new instance to the multimc main menu. We do this either by clicking the button in the top left (image 1) or by right clicking an empty area and clicking "Create instance" (image 2) . The latter is my personal prefered method.

                <div id="text">
                    Next we want to download the pack. We do this by selecting the "Twitch" option on the left and typing in something like "direwolf20" then clicking on the 1.4.7 pack and hitting ok. You can rename it or add it to a group if you want, but it's up to you. It won't  change anything.

                    After this we should be done! The only stuff left is further customization. If you're a "stick to the basics" type then you're all good.

                <div id="text">
                    There is one client mod that makes things a little better, this is the only one I went looking for though so there might be others. Because we're playing in an old version they don't have the mouse slide ability found in later versions. This mod partially implements it. Right click places 1 item per slot, but left click doesn't distribute. Shift left click will move items as you mouse over them like in newer versions.

                    Why am I making a tutorial for downloading texturepacks and etc? Well, at least for this pack, the texturepacks that actually work, or can even be downloaded, are a little more difficult to come by. I spent some time testing them out so no one else had to sit through that. <br><br>
                    Just pick whichever one you want to download and to "install" it either open the instance folder and just add it to the "texturepacks" folder or navigate to it through the menu.

                    The shaders were the most annoying to procure. I don't know when the first shaders mod was made but it's gotta be somewhere close before this. It's all very hacky... so bear with me on this one.<br><br>
                    
                    First we're gonna need to download the shaders mod and the shaderpack. I am hosting both files as they are relatively small and finding them was a pain. In conjunction, the shaders mod has to be integrated with optifine. Optifine for this version also has to be integrated with the minecraft jar file, it can't just be put in the mods folder. I've front-loaded most of the work and it's relatively painless to add now.

                <div id="text">
                    Lets open up the instance console first and we'll go from there.<br><br>

                    There should be some tabs on the left, click "Version."

                <div id="text">
                    Select the optifine zip file that was just downloaded to add to the minecraft jar. It should look like the image below when done. Mine has a different name because I did all the testing to figure stuff out for me before writing the tutorial.

                <div id="text">
                    Now you just need to add the shader pack to the shaderpacks folder. There isn't one created by default so there are two ways to do this. The first is by opening the instance folder and creating a folder called "shaderpacks" and the second is by launching the instance and navigating to it through the menu, similar to how you would add a texturepack from the menu.
                </div>

                <div id="text">
                    A word of caution. The shaders have a few, well, they're not bugs? But they are "hey this doesn't work how they do in the future versions" sorts of things. Notably, water. The water is still shimery and reflective and nice, but going into water is pitch black. I'm not sure exactly why this is, I can make guesses, but the "solution" is to turn on "clear water" in video settings. Another slight problem is that the ice/glacier biome has lighting issues where newly generated ice looks black. <br><br>

                    Another standard warning. Using shaders is more resource intensive than not using it so make sure you can handle it before raiding a dungeon or something.
